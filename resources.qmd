I did not so much create as assemble the materials for this website. 

>**Any errors in this website, however, are mine.** 

When preparing the workshop materials, 

* I pilfered (and benefitted greatly) from Prof [Frank Harrell's](https://www.fharrell.com/) excellent [*Biostatistics for Biomedical Research*](http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf). 

* Josh Starmer's [Statquest](https://statquest.org/) is a also “must go to website” for people interested in gaining a working understanding of biostatistics. 

* [Z Statistics](http://www.zstatistics.com/) is an excellent educational resource for University students and analysts of any stripe.

* I belatedly discovered [Crash Course](https://thecrashcourse.com/courses/statistics) and I think it is a fantastic website.
