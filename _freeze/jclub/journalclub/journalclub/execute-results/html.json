JAMA 2021 Feb 16;325(7):646-657\n\nRead the [abstract](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2776330)\n\n\n\n## Questions\n1. Is this a well-conducted study in terms of study design? (refer to [Pointers](#designlink))\n2. Would you conclude that there is no difference between high vs low-intensity strength training? (refer to [Pointers](#findingslink))\n    a. in terms of self-reported knee pain\n    b. in terms of knee extensor strength\n    c. in terms of hip abductor strength \n    d. in terms of 6-minute walking distance \n3. What are the mechanism of effects of high and low-intensity strength training? (read [Schoenfeld et al](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4663/9/2/32))\n4. What are the implications for clinical practice? \n5. How would you have done the study differently? (Open Question)   \n\n\n## Study Design {#designlink}\nMethods/procedures used by the researchers to reduce/minimize study bias\n\n### Recruitment \n*Participants were not aware of the hypotheses tested*. What are the implications?\n\n### Randomization\nHow does randomization reduce confounding? (**Confounding** Chapter)\n\nWhy was randomization stratified by sex and baseline BMI?(**Confounding** Chapter)\n\n### Analysis\nParticipants were analyzed according to their assigned randomization group *even if they were nonadherent to their assigned intervention* (**Confounding** Chapter)\n\nAnalysis were *adjusted for sex, baseline BMI, and baseline outcome values*  (**Regression** Chapter on ANCOVA)\n\n\n\n## Findings {#findingslink}\nInterpret the RCT findings by quantifying the evidence for/against a treatment effect\nAssociation = Treatment Effect = Treatment Difference \n\n::: l-body\n| Findings              | Interpretation                                    |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| P<0.05  | Evidence of a (non-zero) treatment difference/effect                |\n| P>0.05  | Insufficient/No evidence of association (â‰  evidence of no treatment difference)[^1]           |\n| (1) P<0.05; 95% CIs exclude trivial effects | Evidence of a clinically meaningful treatment difference|\n| (2) P<0.05; 95% CIs exclude meaningful effects | Evidence of a treatment diff; however, this difference is not clinically meaningful|\n| (3) P<0.05; 95% CIs include trivial + meaningful effects | Cannot exclude non-clinically meaningful treatment difference|\n| (4) P>0.05; 95% CIs exclude meaningful effects  | (Possibly) Evidence of no treatment difference       |\n| (5) P>0.05; 95% CI limits include meaningful effects  | CI indicates a wide range of plausible true treatment differences (inconclusive finding as all scenarios are possible)           |\n| (6) P>0.05; 95% CI limits  include trivial + meaningful effects  | No evidence of treatment difference, however, we cannot exclude clinically important difference           |\n:::\n[^1]: Beware of making the \"Absence of Evidence is NOT Evidence of Absence\" fallacy\n\n\nWe are assuming that the 95%CI represent the range of plausible values for the true (hidden) treatment effects. This is, strictly speaking, untrue[^2] (**General Overview** Chapter). \n \n \n[^2]: More accurately, but less comprehensibly, the 95%CI is the range of values computed using a method such that over multiple study replications with a 95% CI computed in each  replication, 95% of the intervals would contain the true treatment effect. \n\n\n\n",
