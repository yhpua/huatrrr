Also, notice that **unadjusted** difference in proportions are given. Hence, it is possible to observe an unadjusted 95%CI that includes 0 but a P-value that is <0.05   \n- Separate regression analysis done at each timepoint: bias from non-random missing observations may creep into results [^1]  \n\n### Practice\n- Table 4: The authors sensibly provided adjusted difference. Try interpreting them.    \n\n### Interesting\n- If we have the time and energy, we could compute ORs by hand (or software)  \n\n[^1]: Certainly a forgivable sin given the limited availability of software to handle more complex models in 2007   \n\n\n ",
