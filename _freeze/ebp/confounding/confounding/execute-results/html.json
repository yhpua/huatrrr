However, a confounder is *not* caused by the predictor\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n### Comprehensive overview provided by [Z Statistics](http://www.zstatistics.com/)\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SjIbrNYAd5Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<aside>\nUse this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjIbrNYAd5Y) if the video doesn't play\n</aside>\n\n\n\n### Example 1: Smoking-CHD Association confounded by Age\n<aside>\nUse this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU6zCCYbGHU) if the video doesn't play\n</aside>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WU6zCCYbGHU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<aside>\nIf you have understood the concepts of confounding, please give credit to this speaker - not me!\n</aside>\n\n\n### Example 2: Confounding by disease severity\n- Patients with greater disease severity (the confounder) are likely to receive more intensive therapy\n\n- Patients with greater disease severity are likely to have poor clinical outcomes\n\n- Thus, we may observe that intensive therapy is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. In other words, disease severity has distorted or confounded the estimation of the true therapy effects\n\n### Example 3: Confounding by treatment indication\n- Confounding caused by variables related to both treatment decision and outcomes\n\n- In clinical practice, a therapist gives Patient A Treatment A and Patient B Treatment B\n\n- We may be tempted to compare Treatment A and Treatment B by comparing the outcomes of Patient A and Patient B. Unfortunately, this comparison of treatment effects is prone to confounding (by indication)\n\n- Potential dangers of ignoring confounding by severity/treatment indication are highlighted [here](https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(19)30370-6/fulltext)  \n\n## Controlling for confounding\n\n- This involves breaking or removing the connection between treatment group variable and the confounder\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/confound_break.png){width=424}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Study Design Method: Randomization\n- Large randomized trials ensure that treatment and control groups are balanced with respect to factors associated with outcomes (eg., age, sex, disease severity, and comorbidity) and they thus provide the optimal approach to address questions about treatment effects\n\n- In an RCT, an intention to treat analysis (ITT) is a method/strategy of data analysis that compares patients in the groups to which they are originally randomly allocated.\n\n- ITT ensures that the treatment groups remain similar in baseline characteristics; hence, ITT minimizes confounding\n\n- RCTs often do not mimic clinical practice because patients enrolled in an RCT can be quite different from patients in clinical practice. This may be **necessary** as it allows an RCT to control for **confounding** when estimating the **true** treatment effects.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![RCT controls confounding. Figure taken from Agoritsas et al [@agoritsas2017]](images/confoundrct.png){fig-align='center' width=85%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Statistical Method: Regression\n- Regression methods condition on confounders when estimating the \"true\" treatment effects\n\n- Conceptually, we are averaging the treatment effects across the levels/strata of the confounder\n\n- Conditioning = Holding values (of the confounder) constant. Because the confounder is held constant at each stratum, regression analyses **attempt** to \"level the playing field\" for treatment groups \n\n- Conditioning can be done using stratification analyses or multivariable regression analyses\n\n- **We adjusted or controlled for age...**: Assessing the effect of one variable while accounting for\nthe effect of another (confounding) variable. In a non-randomized study comparing the effects of treatments\nA and B on blood pressure reduction, the patients' ages may have been used to select the treatment.\nIt would be advisable in that case to control for the effect of age before estimating the treatment\neffect. This can be done using a regression model with blood pressure as the dependent variable and\ntreatment and age as the independent variables (controlling for age using subtraction) or crudely and\napproximately (with some residual confounding) by stratifying by deciles of age and averaging the\ntreatment effects estimated within the deciles. Adjustment results in adjusted odds ratios, adjusted\nhazard ratios, adjusted slopes, etc.\n\n\n<aside>\nTaken from Frank Harrell's [glossary](http://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf) \n</aside>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Statistical adjustment for Age.

Hence, we are constantly haunted by the possibility that residual confounding may creep into our results. Residual confounding is the bias that remains even after statistical adjustment and it is caused by imperfectly measured confounders and unknown confounders.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Confounding in observational study.
