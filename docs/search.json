It would be advisable in that case to control for the effect of age before estimating the treatment effect. This can be done using a regression model with blood pressure as the dependent variable and treatment and age as the independent variables (controlling for age using subtraction) or crudely and approximately (with some residual confounding) by stratifying by deciles of age and averaging the treatment effects estimated within the deciles.

    "text": "Propensity Score Adjustment\n\n\nExcellent tutorial (with helpful audio narration!) by Prof Frank Harrell can be found here\n\n\nHigh-level summary\n\nPropensity score (PS) analysis is a regression-based method that adjusts the treatment effects for many (known) confounders\nPS analysis is used when (i) you need to aggressively adjust the treatment effects for multiple confounders and (ii) the outcome model does not allow multiple variables to be reliably fitted. Thus, PS analysis allows aggressive confounder adjustment without increasing the risk of model overfitting\nTo summarize the confounding information into a single number, a propensity model is created by regressing the treatment status on all the confounders. In that model, the PS is the estimated (conditional) probability of getting treatment B vs. treatment A given a set of (observed/measured) confounding variables.\nResearchers would often use the PS to assess whether they could achieve balance between the treatment groups on the confounders.\nAfter computing the PS, a multivariable outcome model is fitted to estimate the treatment effects. In the outcome model, the PS is simply treated as a covariate. PS adjustment “works” when all relevant variables (important prognostic factors) are included in the propensity model.\n\n\n\nExample\nGornet et al JNS 2015\n\nTo adjust for any possible effects of demographic characteristics or preoperative measures on clinical outcomes, the propensity score technique was used. The propensity score was calculated based on a logistic regression model with the following covariates: age, height, weight, sex, race, marital status, education level, work status, workers’ compensation, spinal litigation, tobacco use, alcohol use, nonnarcotic pain medication use, weak narcotic pain medication use, strong narcotic pain medication use, muscle relaxant medication use, time to onset of symptoms, and previous neck surgery, as well as treatment level and preoperative scores for NDI, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS), SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS), neck pain, arm pain, gait, foraminal compression test reaction, and neurological status (motor function, sensory, and reflex). Where an observation was missing for a given demographic/pre-operative variable in a particular patient, the mean value of the corresponding treatment group was imputed for the missing data point. Covariate balance after propensity score adjustment was examined using ANCOVA or logistic regression."

    "text": "Bayesian Inference\n\nGo to “Overview” chapter (Workshop section)\n\n\nExample\nGornet et al JNS 2015\n\nIn the Frequentist approach, evidence for efficacy is generally thought to be provided by p ≤ 0.05. This is the probability of observing, over repetitions of the same experiment, a test statistic as impressive as or more impressive than the observed statistic for comparing 2 groups if the null hypothesis is true. Bayesian results are “positive,” by comparison, when, for example, the posterior probability of efficacy is ≥ 0.95. For assessing evidence, the Bayesian posterior probability of a statement such as “Treatment 1 tends to be better than Treatment 2” is the probability that the statement is true. In addition, the 95% Bayesian credible intervals are provided for parameters of interest. The primary objective in this study was to show that the overall success rate in the investigational group was statistically noninferior to the rate in the historical control group."
