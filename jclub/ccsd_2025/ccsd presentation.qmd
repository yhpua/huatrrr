## Case Study

## Background


 




::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## MSAS
__Assessment Limits__: MSAS gives maximum scores for patients using gait aids.

__Ceiling Effect__: The instrument fails to differentiate patients in later rehab phases, inadequately measuring their progress.

## Gait Speed[^1]  
- Recommended outcome measure in rehabilitation    
- No upper speed limit = No ceiling effect   
- __Floor effect__ particularly in patients with acute stroke    



[^1]: COI declaration: I have a patent for a device ("SCREENii") that automates the gait speed test, but this device is not used in this case study. But I am not the only person who is fanatical about measuring gait speed!

## MSA"S
- Idea: Extend the MSAS with independent walking speed levels   
- Preserved MSAS acronym by using straight quotation marks to replace "Acute" with "All"    
- Increased maximum MSAS score from 36 to 40 points - psychologically round number

## Data Extraction
Data collected as part of clinical process  
Data Entry is Easy  
Data Extraction is Painful with multiple outcome variables in various __free__ [^2] textboxes   
Time and money needed to include more structured fields   
Method to extract data less painfully  
Requires standardization and cooperation from colleagues  
Step-by-step [guide](https://woonel.github.io/dataextractiontips/data-extraction-tips.html)   

[^2]: __Free__ text is never free: Price for non-standardized data entry

### Regular Expression ("regex")

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: TRUE
outcome1 <- str_extract_all(acl2$value.text, "(?<=\\().*?(?=\\))") # <1>
```
 
1.  regular expression (regex) to find contents that are within brackets

Specialized programming language for pattern matching

## Outcomes

| Ideas | Outcomes |
|------|---------|
|`Bracket Method`[^3]|Used within and outside SGH PT department (e.g., KKH PT, SKH OT depts)|
|`MSA"S Project`|  - One Publication in APMR journal|  
||- Best oral presentation at SingHealth Duke-NUS Scientific Congress 2023  
||- Potentially an outcome measure for One Rehab|

Bring something to the collaboration
