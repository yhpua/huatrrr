## Session (31 Aug 2021) 
> **Messier et al** Effect of High-Intensity Strength Training on Knee Pain and Knee Joint Compressive Forces Among Adults With Knee Osteoarthritis The START Randomized Clinical Trial. JAMA 2021 Feb 16;325(7):646-657

## Questions
1. Is this a well-conducted study in terms of study design? (refer to [Pointers](#designlink))
2. Would you conclude that there is no difference between high vs low-intensity strength training? (refer to [Pointers](#findingslink))
    a. in terms of self-reported knee pain
    b. in terms of knee extensor strength
    c. in terms of hip abductor strength 
    d. in terms of 6-minute walking distance 
3. What are the mechanism of effects of high and low-intensity strength training? (read [Schoenfeld et al](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4663/9/2/32))
4. What are the implications for clinical practice? 
5. How would you have done the study differently? (Open Question)   


## Study Design {#designlink}
Methods/procedures used by the researchers to reduce/minimize study bias

### Recruitment 
*Participants were not aware of the hypotheses tested*. What are the implications?

### Randomization
How does randomization reduce confounding? (**Confounding** Chapter)

Why was randomization stratified by sex and baseline BMI?(**Confounding** Chapter)

### Analysis
Participants were analyzed according to their assigned randomization group *even if they were nonadherent to their assigned intervention* (**Confounding** Chapter)

Analysis were *adjusted for sex, baseline BMI, and baseline outcome values*  (**Regression** Chapter on ANCOVA)



## Findings {#findingslink}
Interpret the RCT findings by quantifying the evidence for/against a treatment effect
Association = Treatment Effect = Treatment Difference

|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| P<0.05  | Evidence of a (non-zero) treatment difference/effect                |
| P>0.05  | Insufficient/No evidence of association (â‰  evidence of no treatment difference)[^1]           |
| (1) P<0.05; 95% CIs exclude trivial effects | Evidence of a clinically meaningful treatment difference|
| (2) P<0.05; 95% CIs exclude meaningful effects | Evidence of a treatment diff; however, this difference is not clinically meaningful|
| (3) P<0.05; 95% CIs include trivial + meaningful effects | Cannot exclude non-clinically meaningful treatment difference|
| (4) P>0.05; 95% CIs exclude meaningful effects  | (Possibly) Evidence of no treatment difference       |
| (5) P>0.05; 95% CI limits include meaningful effects  | CI indicates a wide range of plausible true treatment differences (inconclusive finding as all scenarios are possible)           |
| (6) P>0.05; 95% CI limits  include trivial + meaningful effects  | No evidence of treatment difference, however, we cannot exclude clinically important difference           |
:::
[^1]: Beware of making the "Absence of Evidence is NOT Evidence of Absence" fallacy


We are assuming that the 95%CI represent the range of plausible values for the true (hidden) treatment effects. This is, strictly speaking, untrue[^2] (**General Overview** Chapter). 
 
 
[^2]: More accurately, but less comprehensibly, the 95%CI is the range of values computed using a method such that over multiple study replications with a 95% CI computed in each  replication, 95% of the intervals would contain the true treatment effect.
