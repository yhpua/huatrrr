- Take the tips seriously. Tricks, with a pinch of salt.    


### Overview
$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\text{Good Scientific Writing} &= \text{Good Science} + \text{Good Writing} \\
\text{Good Writing} &= \text{Good English Grammar, Usage, and Style } \\ 
\text{Good Writing} &=  \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{ Reading (See)} + \beta_2\text{ Practice (Do)} + \beta_3\text{ Criticism (Feedback)} \text{,  where}\\ 
\beta_0 &=  \text {Baseline level of writing skills} \\
\end{array} 
$$


[See-Do-Feedback](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/04/21/see-do-feedback/) are the components of effective practice

### Reading  

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Trick 1: Read widely  
* Elliott E, Baur L, Keena V. [Scientific Writing: Easy When You  Know How](https://image.sciencenet.cn/olddata/kexue.com.cn/upload/blog/file/2010/11/2010111022210817101.pdf). BMJ Books, London. 2002.
* Gopen GD, Swan JA. [The science of scientific writing](https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/the-long-view/the-science-of-scientific-writing). Am. Sci. 1990; 78: 550–8.   
* Journals with (usually) very well-written articles   
  + [Annals of Internal Medicine](https://www.acpjournals.org/journal/aim)
  + [Anesthesia analgesia](https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/pages/default.aspx)  
  + [BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj-2023-077143)   
  + [Circulation](https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/circ)  
  + [Chest](https://journal.chestnet.org/)  
  



### Trick 2: Seek widely 
* Analogous field thinking: seek solutions from subject areas that seem different on the surface but similar on a deep structural level  
* [Sometimes the best ideas come from outside your industry](https://hbr.org/2014/11/sometimes-the-best-ideas-come-from-outside-your-industry) HBR 2014
* Example: [Discordance Paper](https://www.arthroplastyjournal.org/article/S0883-5403(23)00264-4/abstract)
  + Discordance between self-reported and performance-based measures of physical disability in people with knee osteoarthritis  
  + Discordance between total cholesterol to HDL ratio in comparison with LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol (Ref 20)

### Practice  

::: {.panel-tabset}
### Trick 3: Create standalone Tables  
```{r}
#| label: info_table
#| fig-cap: "Informative Table Caption"
#| warning: false
#| column: page
#| echo: false
#| out.width: "900px"
knitr::include_graphics("cload.jpg")
```

::: {.column-margin}
Table taken from [Pandharipande et al](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1301372)  
:::

### Trick 4: Create standalone Figures
```{r}
#| label: info_figure
#| fig-cap: "Informative Figure Caption"
#| warning: false
#| column: page
#| echo: false
#| out.width: "900px"
knitr::include_graphics("fig_cload.png")
```

### Criticism
- Feedback from fellow co-authors can sometimes be too soft and congratulatory to cut deep at what works and what doesn't work in your writing.    

::: {.callout-tip}
# Trick 5
Pluck up your courage and email authors whom you admire[^1]!

### Summary
* The rhetoric of research is often about fun and creativity but the reality is that research (including scientific writing) can be taxing and uncomfortable.

## Trick 6
>  The trick is not minding that the process is hard. 

Taken from [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/09/26/10x-rule-ambitious-goals/)

In a scene in Lawrence of Arabia, the titular T. E. Lawrence lights a cigarette and puts out the match by rubbing it between his fingers. Shortly after, another man attempts the same trick:

<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 0px; padding: 0px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">
Man: Oh! [burning his fingers] It damn well hurts!

Lawrence: Certainly it does.

Man: Well what’s the trick then? 

Lawrence: The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.
</div>
