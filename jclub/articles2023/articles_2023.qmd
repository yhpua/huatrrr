## RCT paper
The Group has chosen [JNNP 2007 Asburn et al](https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/78/7/678.long)  

### Plus Points
- The authors adjusted for baseline SAS and previous history of falls  (to "level the playing field" for both groups)


### Minus Points
- Table 3: It is shame that readers are only given P-values to guide their interpretation of the regression results. Also, notice that **unadjusted** difference in proportions are given. Hence, it is possible to observe an unadjusted 95%CI that includes 0 but a P-value that is <0.05   
- Separate regression analysis done at each timepoint: bias from non-random missing observations may creep into results [^1]  

### Practice
- Table 4: The authors sensibly provided adjusted difference. Try interpreting them.    

### Interesting
- If we have the time and energy, we could compute ORs by hand (or software)  

[^1]: Certainly a forgivable sin given the limited availability of software to handle more complex models in 2007
