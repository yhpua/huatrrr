### High-level summary
- Propensity score (PS) analysis is a regression-based method that adjusts the treatment effects for many (*known*) confounders 
- PS analysis is used when (i) you need to aggressively adjust the treatment effects for multiple confounders and (ii) the outcome model does not allow multiple variables to be reliably fitted. Thus, PS analysis allows aggressive confounder adjustment **without** increasing the risk of model overfitting
- To summarize the confounding information into a single number, a propensity model is created by regressing the treatment status on all the confounders. In that model, the PS is the estimated (conditional) probability of getting treatment B vs. treatment A given a set of (observed/measured) confounding variables. 
- Researchers would often use the PS to assess whether they could achieve balance between the treatment groups on the confounders. 
- After computing the PS, a multivariable outcome model is fitted to estimate the treatment effects. In the outcome model, the PS is simply treated as a covariate. PS adjustment "works" when **all** relevant variables (important prognostic factors) are included in the propensity model.

> To adjust for any possible effects of demographic characteristics or preoperative measures on clinical outcomes, the propensity score technique was used. The propensity score was calculated based on a logistic regression model with the following covariates: age, height, weight, sex, race, marital status, education level, work status, workers' compensation, spinal litigation, tobacco use, alcohol use, nonnarcotic pain medication use, weak narcotic pain medication use, strong narcotic pain medication use, muscle relaxant medication use, time to onset of symptoms, and previous neck surgery, as well as treatment level and preoperative scores for NDI, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS), SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS), neck pain, arm pain, gait, foraminal compression test reaction, and neurological status (motor function, sensory, and reflex). Where an observation was missing for a given demographic/pre-operative variable in a particular patient, the mean value of the corresponding treatment group was imputed for the missing data point. Covariate balance after propensity score adjustment was examined using ANCOVA or logistic regression.

> In the Frequentist approach, evidence for efficacy is generally thought to be provided by p ≤ 0.05. This is the probability of observing, over repetitions of the same experiment, a test statistic as impressive as or more impressive than the observed statistic for comparing 2 groups if the null hypothesis is true. Bayesian results are “positive,” by comparison, when, for example, the posterior probability of efficacy is ≥ 0.95. For assessing evidence, the Bayesian posterior probability of a statement such as “Treatment 1 tends to be better than Treatment 2” is the probability that the statement is true. In addition, the 95% Bayesian credible intervals are provided for parameters of interest. The primary objective in this study was to show that the overall success rate in the investigational group was statistically noninferior to the rate in the historical control group.
