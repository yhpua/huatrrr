## Cross-sectional study
[BMC Geriatrics 2022](https://bmcgeriatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12877-022-02883-1)    

- Table 1: Participants may want to try their hands on computing the ORs since the 2x2 table cell values are given   
- Comment on the **non-significant** ORs[^1] for the `Age`, `Multi-morbidity`, `Falls within 6 months` variables in the multivariable[^2] logistic regression analyses     

- Is dichotomizing FoF into `high` vs `low/moderate` levels and computing ORs a good idea? If not, what are the alternatives?    

- Chi-squared test is a special case of logistic regression so the analyses could be greatly simplified/unified   
 
 

[^1]: Table 2: exponentiating the regression coefficients (`Exp(B)`) returns the adjusted odds ratio (ORs)
