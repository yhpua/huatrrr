<!-- # Confounding -->
<!-- ## Question: Good or Bad? -->
<!-- >> RCTs often do not mimic clinical practice because patients enrolled in an RCT can be quite different from patients in clinical practice -->
<!-- - This may be **necessary** as it allows an RCT to control for **confounding** when estimating the **true** treatment effects -->
<!-- - Another goal of an RCT is to estimate [relative](http://www.fharrell.com/post/rct-mimic/) treatment effects -->

## Definition 
- Confounding is the bias or systematic error in the estimation of true treatment (predictor) effects

- Confounding is caused by a variable ("confounder") that is related to *both* predictor and outcome. However, a confounder is *not* caused by the predictor

### Example 2: Confounding by disease severity
- Patients with greater disease severity (the confounder) are likely to receive more intensive therapy

- Patients with greater disease severity are likely to have poor clinical outcomes

- Thus, we may observe that intensive therapy is associated with poorer clinical outcomes. In other words, disease severity has distorted or confounded the estimation of the true therapy effects

### Example 3: Confounding by treatment indication
- Confounding caused by variables related to both treatment decision and outcomes

- In clinical practice, a therapist gives Patient A Treatment A and Patient B Treatment B

- We may be tempted to compare Treatment A and Treatment B by comparing the outcomes of Patient A and Patient B. Unfortunately, this comparison of treatment effects is prone to confounding (by indication)

- Potential dangers of ignoring confounding by severity/treatment indication are highlighted [here](https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(19)30370-6/fulltext)  

## Controlling for confounding

- This involves breaking or removing the connection between treatment group variable and the confounder

### Study Design Method: Randomization
- Large randomized trials ensure that treatment and control groups are balanced with respect to factors associated with outcomes (eg., age, sex, disease severity, and comorbidity) and they thus provide the optimal approach to address questions about treatment effects

- In an RCT, an intention to treat analysis (ITT) is a method/strategy of data analysis that compares patients in the groups to which they are originally randomly allocated.

- ITT ensures that the treatment groups remain similar in baseline characteristics; hence, ITT minimizes confounding

- RCTs often do not mimic clinical practice because patients enrolled in an RCT can be quite different from patients in clinical practice. This may be **necessary** as it allows an RCT to control for **confounding** when estimating the **true** treatment effects.

```


### Statistical Method: Regression
- Regression methods condition on confounders when estimating the "true" treatment effects

- Conceptually, we are averaging the treatment effects across the levels/strata of the confounder

- Conditioning = Holding values (of the confounder) constant. Because the confounder is held constant at each stratum, regression analyses **attempt** to "level the playing field" for treatment groups 

- Conditioning can be done using stratification analyses or multivariable regression analyses

- **We adjusted or controlled for age...**: Assessing the effect of one variable while accounting for
the effect of another (confounding) variable. In a non-randomized study comparing the effects of treatments
A and B on blood pressure reduction, the patients' ages may have been used to select the treatment.
It would be advisable in that case to control for the effect of age before estimating the treatment
effect. This can be done using a regression model with blood pressure as the dependent variable and
treatment and age as the independent variables (controlling for age using subtraction) or crudely and
approximately (with some residual confounding) by stratifying by deciles of age and averaging the
treatment effects estimated within the deciles. Adjustment results in adjusted odds ratios, adjusted
hazard ratios, adjusted slopes, etc.

### Comparison 

- Large randomized trials ensure that treatment and control groups are balanced with respect to (known and unknown) factors associated with outcomes (typically age, sex, disease severity, and comorbidity — “prognostic factors”) and thus provide the optimal approach to address questions about the benefits and harms of interventions.

- Observational treatment comparisons = No treatment group randomization = More "real world" (reflective of clinical practice) = Greater risk of (known and **unknown**) confounding when estimating therapy effects 

- In observational treatment comparisons, we could use regression methods to adjust for **known** confounding. Hence, we are constantly haunted by the possibility that residual confounding may creep into our results. Residual confounding is the bias that remains even after statistical adjustment and it is caused by imperfectly measured confounders and unknown confounders.
